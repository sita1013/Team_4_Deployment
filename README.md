# Team 4 CS551Q Django App

Our project was to show the PM2.5 levels of each country for the years that were provided in the excel sheet.
The current website shows these levels and has drop down boxes dedicated to countries and years. There is a second
page where the user can compare two countries using a bar graph. 


## Features
- Hompage = 
  introduces the user to the site with two options to either search for country or compare two countries. 
- Search for Country =
  gives drop down option for the user to pick country and year. Also can start typing to get
  to the country or year more quickly. Page does allow for user to return to Homepage or Compare Two Countries page. 
- Compare Two Countries =
  provides two drop down menus for the user to choose for countries and another drop down menu
  for the user to choose year. Page allows for user to return to Homepage or Search for One Country again. 


## Folder Structure

## Technologies
Backend: Django 4.x
Frontend: HTML, Django Templates, Chart.js
Database: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (intended for production)
Cloud URL: https://team-4-deployment-1.onrender.com/

## Notes
We initially planned to use PostgreSQL for deployment and API-driven frontend interactions.
Due to limitations in Codio, we used SQLite for development. We aim to shift to PostgreSQL for final deployment using VS Code or other cloud environments. 

All logic and data manipulation is handled server-side in views. JavaScript is only used to render Chart.js visuals using safely passed JSON data from the backend.
